## [Project 1: Linear Regression using Boston Housing Dataset](https://github.com/nirantbendale/Linear-Regression)
**The "Boston Housing Prices Prediction with Linear Regression" project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to predicting housing prices using Linear Regression. It begins with data exploration and visualization, followed by model building, training, and evaluation. The project highlights the importance of EDA in understanding the dataset and selecting relevant features. The Linear Regression model provides insights into feature importance and predicts housing prices with reasonable accuracy.**
**This project serves as a foundational example for regression tasks, showcasing the application of machine learning to real-world datasets and the importance of data analysis in the modeling process.**

## [Project 2: Logistic Regression using RMS Titanic Dataset]([https://github.com/nirantbendale/Logistic-Regression/tree/main](https://github.com/nirantbendale/Logistic-Regression/tree/main))
**This project utilizes Logistic Regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on key factors like passenger class, gender, and age. After loading and preprocessing the dataset, exploratory data analysis is performed to uncover insights and correlations. Relevant features are selected, data is split for training and testing, and the Logistic Regression model is trained. Predictions are made, and the model's accuracy is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and a confusion matrix. The project serves as an illustrative example of binary classification using a classic dataset, demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to real-world scenarios, such as predicting survival outcomes in historical events.**
