## [Project 1: Linear Regression using Boston Housing Dataset](https://github.com/nirantbendale/Linear-Regression)
**The "Boston Housing Prices Prediction with Linear Regression" project demonstrates a step-by-step approach to predicting housing prices using Linear Regression. It begins with data exploration and visualization, followed by model building, training, and evaluation. The project highlights the importance of EDA in understanding the dataset and selecting relevant features. The Linear Regression model provides insights into feature importance and predicts housing prices with reasonable accuracy.**
**This project serves as a foundational example for regression tasks, showcasing the application of machine learning to real-world datasets and the importance of data analysis in the modeling process.**
